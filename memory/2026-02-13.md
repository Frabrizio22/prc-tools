# 2026-02-13 — Late Night Session (Paris Flight)

## Affiliate Links & Codes
- Extracted all affiliate data from Frabrizio's price comparison .docx
- **26 total affiliate vendors** confirmed — 4 with referral-tracked URLs, 25 with discount codes
- 6 vendors were missing from vendor directory (AIO, Authentic Aminos, BC9, Elev8, EQNO, TCore) — added to Green tier
- Ascension Peptides URL added (ascensionpeptides.com)
- Tydes had wrong code "REFYESENIACA" → fixed to "Kikiriki"
- All 26 verified against docx source of truth

## QA Deep Dive
- Fixed **211 broken `</span>` tags** — "Green/span>" missing `<` across all tiers
- Fixed footer labels missing onclick handlers (iOS Safari tab switching)
- Updated vendor filter pill counts (117/110/26/140 = 393 total)
- Disclaimer now mentions Yellow tier
- Affiliate vendor names styled blue (clickable)
- Comparison tool vendor links styled blue

## Reconstitution Calculator
- Built and added to Resources tab
- Fields: peptide mg, bac water mL, desired dose mcg, doses per day
- Calculates: concentration, volume to draw (mL + syringe units), doses per vial, vial duration
- Added dark navy header banner (matches comparison tool style)
- Added step-by-step guide explaining each field
- Added plain-English summary of results
- Fixed iOS Safari input bug: switched from type="number" to type="text" inputmode="decimal" with triple event binding (oninput + onkeyup + onchange)

## Visual Upgrade
- Jessie reviewed site and said "this is trash" / "looks like 200 other websites" / "wants to stand out"
- She wants: variety of fonts, cohesive themes, dynamic pages (moving words), visual engagement
- Added: serif headings (Georgia), hero fade-up animations, scroll animations (fade-in on scroll), hover effects (tile lift, button scale), teal+navy gradient with shimmer
- **Key lesson: Jessie wants PRC to have its own distinct identity, not generic template look**
- Need screenshots from Jessie of sites she thinks stand out — fastest path to her vision
- Real visual polish should happen on WooCommerce (prcpeptides.com), not the static mockup
