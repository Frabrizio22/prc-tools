# 2026-02-14 — Session Notes

## Strategy Pivot: Single Brand, Two Sites Confirmed
- Frabrizio asked about traffic without resource center → I explained RC is the traffic engine
- He considered putting everything on one site → I initially agreed (mistake) → he corrected me: **two-site strategy stays**
- **Final confirmed strategy:**
  - **peptideresourcecenter.com (Wix)** = resource center + blog + SEO content + tools (comparison, vendor directory, calculator) + education
  - **prcpeptides.com (WooCommerce)** = pure shop, checkout, payment processing
- No blog/content on prcpeptides.com — keep it clean store only
- Wix is fine for resource center (free, functional, handles blogs + iframes)
- Reddit links → always to resource center, never to shop (Reddit bans shop links)
- Funnel: Reddit/SEO → Resource Center → Trust → Shop

## Site Mockup Updates
- Hero logo was too small (120px) → bumped to height-constrained 200px desktop / 160px mobile
- Stats switched to **pill style** (frosted glass pills) per Frabrizio's preference
- Tightened hero spacing — less dead blue space
- Commits: `fed4afb` → `0068500` → `48f8784`

## PRC Peptides Shop Mockup Built
- New file: `prcpeptides_mockup.html` → deployed at `shop.html` on GitHub Pages
- **Shop v2** features: blue gradient hero, pill stats, dark navy trust bar (horizontal), categories dropdown nav, horizontal scroll filter pills, product grid, modals
- All 44 products included with full descriptions
- "Contact to Order" buttons (no real checkout yet)
- Links back to peptideresourcecenter.com for resources
- Frabrizio said v1 was "boring" → v2 much more polished
- Commits: `ece3cf6` (v1) → `806b09c` (v2)
- **URL:** https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/shop.html

## Key Lesson
- Don't flip-flop on strategy. Frabrizio called me out for suggesting single-site after I'd recommended two-site. Stick to the plan unless there's a real reason to change.
