# 2026-02-13 — Session Notes

## Major Progress
- **RED vendor cross-reference complete** — Subagent processed 11 Wix screenshots, all 45 red vendors were already captured, 7 vendor notes updated for legal safety. Commit `abfc3d7`.
- **Vendor count now 382** — subagent added vendors during cross-reference (was 325). Green 53(?), Orange 25, Red 139. Yellow tier added by Frabrizio with 108 vendors.
- **Yellow tier is live** — Frabrizio added Yellow tier (108 vendors) to the site. Definition: "Vendors we don't have information on, haven't heard anything negative about, or haven't worked with."
- **Email decided**: contact@peptideresourcecenter.com for resource center site, support@prcpeptides.com for store. Both forward to prcpeptides@gmail.com.
- **Tier descriptions approved** — Frabrizio confirmed Green/Yellow/Orange/Red tier text matches Wix. Screenshot msg 1764 shows it live.
- **Broken submodule fix (again)** — prc-tools kept re-adding as submodule. Added to .gitignore this time. Commit `6f7682d`.
- **Tab switching bug** — Shop/Learn/Contact tabs showed blank content on iOS Safari. Added `!important` to JS display override. Commit `f02be20`.

## Vendor Tier Counts (current)
- Green: ~110 (per screenshot)
- Yellow: 108 (NEW — added by Frabrizio)
- Orange: 25
- Red: 139
- Total: 382

## Key Decisions
- **contact@peptideresourcecenter.com** — chosen for resource center (covers affiliates, ratings, product questions)
- **support@prcpeptides.com** — for the store site
- Both forward to prcpeptides@gmail.com (one inbox)
- Vendor tier descriptions match Wix wording — approved by Frabrizio

## Open Issues
- Tab switching on iOS Safari may still not work — pushed fix but untested by Frabrizio yet
- Hero stats say "382 Vendors Reviewed" — correct now
- Frabrizio wants a subtle "Shop PRC Products" element (mentioned it again, already exists in Vendors tab as callout banner)
- Grey tier (China direct sellers) still not implemented

## Frabrizio Context
- Currently in NYC/Paris transit (JFK → CDG)
- Actively testing site on iPhone via Telegram browser + Safari
- Very engaged tonight — rapid iteration cycle
