## Shop Mockup Progress (morning session — many iterations)
- Product order optimized by market demand (GLP first → Advanced last). Commit `9579d37`
- Category color psychology applied (10 categories, research-backed colors). Commit `a7010e8`
- SVG icons replaced emoji cart/search. Commit `3a84bf1`
- Hamburger menu CSS fix (`!important` + CSS order). Commit `bc2d6c1`
- **QA polish pass**: removed redundant sections, cleaner badges (no bubble/border, just colored text), tighter spacing. Commit `46b7e9e`
- **Killed redundant "Shop by Category" section** — filter pills do the same job. Commit `2c4cf5a`
- **Mobile-first layout**: sticky filter pills, removed featured section initially. Commit `b92deaa`
- **Trust bar redesigned**: dark navy → light gray with green ✓ checkmarks, 3 items only (≥98% Purity, Free Recon Kit, Fast Shipping). Compact featured "Bestsellers" row brought back.
- **Premium overhaul**: dark navy footer (© 2026 PRC Labs LLC), header scroll shadow, removed blue left borders from product cards, product descriptions limited to 1 line, filter pill labels shortened (GLP, Neuro, etc.). Commit `ecf2123`
- **Hero refined**: "Research-Grade Peptides" + "No hype. Just peptides." — promo bar: "FREE SHIPPING over $150 · Free recon kit included". Commit `0f18791`
- **Latest shop commit**: `0f18791`

## Key Design Decisions (this session)
- **No category badge bubbles/borders** — just colored text labels
- **No product descriptions on mobile** — 1 line max, cards are compact
- **No product card left borders** — clean white cards with subtle hover
- **Trust bar is LIGHT (gray bg, green checks)** not dark — avoids 3 dark bars stacked
- **Promo bar stays dark** at very top
- **Footer is dark navy** — bookends with promo bar
- **Hero + Trust bar + Promo bar each have distinct jobs**: Promo=offers, Hero=brand+slogan, Trust=proof points. NO repetition between them.
- **"Popular" → "Bestsellers"** as small caps gray label
- **Filter pills are sticky** at top:47px when scrolling
- **Mobile first** — 73%+ of e-commerce is mobile, peptide buyers come from Reddit/Telegram (phone-first)
- **Products on homepage IS standard** for <100 product shops — no separate shop page needed
- **Slogan strategy**: "No hype. Just peptides." on shop / "The vendor that reviews vendors." on resource center

## Competitor Research (for UX)
- Strate Labs: homepage shows categories by product type (Capsules, Peptides, Liquids, Spray Kits) with product images, horizontal scroll rows per category
- Limitless Life: "Shop by Research Category ▾" dropdown in nav, "Buy Peptides by Category" image cards, "Featured Products" row
- Swiss Chems: "Most Popular" featured row → category pills → product grid. Most similar to our approach.
- All show products directly on homepage for catalogs under ~100 items

## Decisions
- SiteGround recommended for WooCommerce hosting ($2.99/mo StartUp plan, Chicago datacenter)
- Skip Namecheap hosting/email/PremiumDNS upsells — just domain + privacy
- Coinbase Commerce: Frabrizio was on wrong page (enterprise). Correct URL: commerce.coinbase.com
- Return policy: no need to ship back damaged items (not worth the cost)
- PRC ships next business day — confirmed by Frabrizio

## In-Progress Work
- **Shop mockup premium QA pass** — was mid-edit when session compacted. Changes in progress:
  - "View Details →" → teal "Order Now" button (CSS class .order-btn added)
  - Price made bigger (1.1rem, 800 weight)
  - Bestseller cards: gray bg (#F8FAFC), slightly larger (min-width 140px)
  - Featured section padding tightened to 0.75rem 0 0.5rem
  - STILL NEED: email signup strip before footer, push to GitHub
  - Latest pushed commit: `a43411c` (prices + COA badges)
  - Unpushed changes in prcpeptides_mockup.html
- **Reddit playbook COMPLETE** — saved to reddit_playbook.md (34KB). Not yet sent to Frabrizio.

## Competitive QA Findings (vs Swiss Chems, Limitless Life)
- Swiss Chems: product images, red "Add to Cart" buttons, category pills, email signup
- Limitless Life: product images, price ranges, category images, email capture popup
- PRC advantages: cleaner layout, better slogan, faster load (no images to load)
- PRC gaps: no Add to Cart button (fixed → "Order Now"), no product images (can't fix yet), no email signup (adding)

## Pending Questions (waiting on Frabrizio)
- **Prices for shop mockup**: Need current price list for all 44 products. Can pull from Wix site but may be outdated. Asked Frabrizio to confirm.
- **COAs**: Previously told "we will tell you what products have COAs later." Frabrizio now asked to add COA availability to product cards — need to know: which products have COAs? Where are they hosted (PDFs, email request)?

## Reddit Playbook
- First sub-agent ran but failed to save file. Respawned with explicit save instructions.
- File should be at: reddit_playbook.md

## Rob Sandie Group Chat (afternoon)
- Rob joined group chat "Frabrizio, Rob and PRC Concierge" (-5264206095)
- Rob challenged WooCommerce recommendation: "Why WordPress at all and not a codebase that we are in full control of?"
- Rob pushed: "How long would it take YOU to build a checkout?" — key question
- **I revised my recommendation**: If I can build custom checkout in 1-2 days, WooCommerce speed argument disappears → custom is the better path
- Rob asked for deep research on competitor checkout systems — evaluated 3 sites:
  - **Core Peptides** (corepeptides.com): WooCommerce, credit cards (Mastercard via high-risk processor), 103 products, volume discounts, same-day shipping before 1pm PST
  - **Biotech Peptides** (biotechpeptides.com): WooCommerce, credit cards accepted, customer reviews (social proof), nearly identical to Core
  - **Limitless Peptides** (limitlesspeptides.com): **Shopify** — risky, could get shut down. ~20 products, premium positioning, Janoshik testing. 21+ age gate.
- **Key insight**: All three accept credit cards via high-risk processors. None offer crypto. Simple checkout flows. The bar is low — we can beat it with custom build + crypto option.
- Frabrizio gave green light (💚) to the custom build direction

## Strategic Pivot
- **DROPPED WooCommerce/SiteGround plan** — going custom build instead
- Stack if custom: Next.js + PostgreSQL + Coinbase Commerce + high-risk gateway iframe
- Rob was right to push on this — saved us from unnecessary platform dependency

## Frabrizio Status
- Still in Paris (until Feb 24). Has laptop + iPhone.
- Working from phone mostly via Telegram.
- 9 hours ahead of PST (Paris time).
