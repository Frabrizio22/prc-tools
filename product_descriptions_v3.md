**SEO Title:** "Semax 5mg | ≥98% Pure | ACTH-Derived Nootropic Peptide | PRC Peptides"

**The only synthetic ACTH analogue specifically engineered to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and elevate BDNF expression.**

Semax emerged from the same Moscow laboratory that produced Selank, but with an entirely different objective: augmenting cognitive capacity through neurotrophic upregulation. This heptapeptide analogue of the ACTH(4-10) fragment demonstrates a mechanism rare among small peptides—it crosses the blood-brain barrier intact and directly increases brain-derived neurotrophic factor expression in cortical and hippocampal regions. The result: enhanced neuroplasticity, improved dopaminergic and serotonergic tone, and measurable effects on memory consolidation in experimental models.

Where most nootropics rely on neurotransmitter modulation alone, Semax operates upstream—influencing the very production of proteins that govern synaptic remodeling. Its effects on cerebrovascular function have made it a staple in stroke recovery research, while cognitive neuroscientists value its ability to enhance working memory without stimulant-like side effects.

Delta Sleep-Inducing Peptide represents a landmark discovery in chronobiology. Isolated from the cerebral venous blood of sleeping rabbits in 1977 by Swiss researchers Schoenenberger and Monnier, DSIP opened scientific inquiry into endogenous sleep architecture modulation. Unlike sedatives that suppress neural activity, this nonapeptide appears to facilitate natural sleep-wake transitions through circadian rhythm entrainment and stress hormone regulation.

The peptide's mechanism extends beyond simple sleep induction: it modulates stress response systems, exhibits analgesic properties in pain perception studies, and demonstrates cortisol-regulating effects that have made it valuable in neuroendocrine research. Decades of investigation have revealed DSIP's subtle, multi-system influence—acting more as a biological rhythm optimizer than a traditional sleep agent.

**SEO Title:** "DSIP Night Blend | ≥98% Pure | Synergistic Sleep Research Complex | PRC Peptides"

**A rare multi-peptide formulation combining three complementary sleep-regulating neuropeptides studied for their synergistic effects on circadian biology.**

Sleep architecture involves layered neurochemical systems—GABAergic inhibition, serotonergic tone, melatonergic timing, and neuropeptide signaling all converge to orchestrate restorative sleep. This proprietary blend recognizes that complexity, combining DSIP with complementary peptides that target distinct but overlapping pathways in sleep-wake regulation. The formulation enables researchers to investigate multi-system sleep modulation in ways single-agent studies cannot capture.

Unlike crude sedative approaches, this blend mirrors the brain's endogenous sleep-promoting cascade—facilitating rather than forcing the transition to restorative sleep states. Chronobiology researchers studying circadian misalignment, sleep disorder pathophysiology, or the molecular architecture of sleep cycles find this combination invaluable for modeling natural sleep regulation.

**The only commercially available multi-factor neurotrophic complex that mimics endogenous brain-derived growth factors across multiple receptor systems.**

Cerebrolysin stands apart in neuroprotection research: where most compounds target a single pathway, this pharmaceutical-grade preparation contains a complex mixture of low-molecular-weight neuropeptides and amino acids derived from porcine brain tissue. The result is a biological profile that simultaneously activates multiple neurotrophic signaling cascades—mimicking BDNF, NGF, CNTF, and GDNF pathways that govern neuroplasticity, cell survival, and synaptic remodeling.

Developed in Austria and extensively studied across European and Asian research institutions, Cerebrolysin has accumulated over 300 published studies in neurodegenerative disease models, stroke recovery, and traumatic brain injury research. Its mechanism—providing exogenous neurotrophic support when endogenous systems fail—makes it irreplaceable in neuroprotection studies where single-target interventions prove insufficient.

Retatrutide represents the frontier of incretin research. Building on tirzepatide's dual-agonist success, Eli Lilly scientists engineered this peptide with an unprecedented pharmacological profile: balanced activation of three distinct hormone receptors—GLP-1, GIP, and glucagon. This triple agonism creates a metabolic phenotype unattainable through any combination of existing compounds: incretin-mediated glucose regulation and appetite suppression, plus glucagon-driven energy expenditure.

The addition of glucagon receptor activity—traditionally avoided in metabolic therapies due to hyperglycemic concerns—proves synergistic when balanced with GLP-1 and GIP signaling. Researchers investigating energy balance, thermogenesis, complex metabolic pathway interactions, or next-generation incretin pharmacology find retatrutide essential for exploring multi-receptor agonism strategies.

**Research Applications:**

**The truncated yet fully bioactive fragment of human GHRH—a 29-amino acid sequence that retains complete growth hormone releasing activity.**

Sermorelin represents elegant peptide design: by identifying the minimal bioactive sequence within full-length GHRH(1-44), researchers created a compound with identical receptor activity but enhanced stability and reduced immunogenicity. This 29-amino acid fragment contains the entire receptor-binding domain, making it indispensable for studying GHRH receptor pharmacology without the complications of the full 44-residue hormone.

The peptide binds selectively to GHRH receptors on pituitary somatotrophs, triggering endogenous growth hormone release through natural pulsatile mechanisms. Unlike exogenous growth hormone administration, sermorelin preserves the physiological feedback loops governing GH secretion, making it the preferred tool for studying growth hormone axis regulation, pituitary function, and the upstream control of IGF-1 production.

**Research Applications:** 
GHRH receptor binding studies, pituitary somatotroph function, growth hormone secretion dynamics, pulsatile GH release mechanisms, IGF-1 pathway research, growth hormone axis physiology

**The most selective growth hormone secretagogue available—a pentapeptide with exceptional specificity for GH release without prolactin or cortisol elevation.**

Ipamorelin solved a critical problem in growth hormone secretagogue research: earlier ghrelin mimetics like GHRP-6 and GHRP-2 stimulated GH release but also elevated prolactin and cortisol through off-target receptor activation. Novo Nordisk's Ipamorelin, a carefully designed pentapeptide, demonstrates near-exclusive selectivity for the ghrelin receptor (GHS-R1a) on somatotrophs, triggering GH secretion without the hormonal side effects that confound experimental interpretation.

This selectivity makes ipamorelin the gold standard for dissecting ghrelin receptor pharmacology and GH secretion mechanisms. Researchers studying the distinction between GHRH-mediated and ghrelin-mediated GH release, or investigating selective GH secretagogue approaches, find this peptide essential for clean, interpretable results.

**A strategically modified GHRH analogue with enhanced proteolytic resistance—offering the benefits of extended stability without the prolonged binding of DAC-conjugated versions.**

CJC-1295 without Drug Affinity Complex (commonly called Modified GRF 1-29 or Mod GRF) represents refined GHRH analogue design. Through targeted amino acid substitutions at positions vulnerable to enzymatic cleavage, researchers created a peptide significantly more stable than natural GHRH yet without the week-long half-life of DAC-conjugated CJC-1295. This intermediate stability profile proves ideal for studying pulsatile GH release—the natural physiological pattern that continuous GHRH exposure would obscure.

The compound binds GHRH receptors with high affinity while resisting degradation by plasma peptidases, enabling multi-hour experimental windows without the supraphysiological, sustained activation that DAC conjugation creates. Researchers investigating natural GH pulse architecture, GHRH receptor desensitization, or physiological GH secretion patterns prefer this version for its balance of stability and pulsatility.

### CJC-1295/Ipamorelin Combination (5mg/5mg)
**Dual Growth Hormone Secretagogue** | **Purity:** ≥98% (per component) | **Origin:** Synergistic research formulation

**SEO Title:** "CJC-1295/Ipamorelin 5mg/5mg | ≥98% Pure | Dual GH Pathway Blend | PRC Peptides"

**A precision-balanced combination targeting both GHRH and ghrelin pathways—enabling investigation of synergistic GH secretion mechanisms that single agents cannot reveal.**

Growth hormone release is governed by two parallel pathways: GHRH signaling through pituitary GHRH receptors, and ghrelin acting via GHS-R1a receptors. This combination recognizes that dual-pathway activation produces supra-additive effects—the GH pulse amplitude from combined GHRH/ghrelin agonism exceeds the sum of individual stimulation. The mechanism involves distinct intracellular signaling cascades that converge on GH granule release, with ghrelin potentially amplifying GHRH's effects through calcium mobilization.

Researchers studying GH secretion physiology, investigating secretagogue synergy, or modeling maximal endogenous GH release find this pre-optimized ratio invaluable. The combination eliminates dosing variables, ensuring consistent GHRH:ghrelin pathway stimulation across experiments—a critical factor in reproducible GH research.

**Bioidentical 191-amino acid human growth hormone produced via recombinant DNA technology—the reference standard for GH receptor research.**

This represents human somatotropin in its native form: 191 amino acids in the precise sequence and tertiary structure found in pituitary-derived growth hormone. Produced through recombinant DNA technology in E. coli expression systems, this rHGH is structurally indistinguishable from endogenous GH, making it the unambiguous choice for studying growth hormone receptor binding, GH-mediated signal transduction, and the direct effects of somatotropin on target tissues.

Where secretagogues provide indirect GH elevation through endogenous release, direct GH administration enables precise dose-response studies, receptor saturation experiments, and investigation of GH signaling independent of pituitary function. With over four decades of research characterizing GH's effects on IGF-1 production, lipolysis, protein synthesis, and tissue remodeling, this molecule remains central to endocrine and metabolic research.

This combination targets multiple phases simultaneously. BPC-157, a pentadecapeptide partial sequence of the body protection compound isolated from gastric juice, demonstrates remarkable cytoprotective properties in mucosal tissue while promoting angiogenesis through VEGF modulation. TB-500 (Thymosin Beta-4 fragment) facilitates actin polymerization and cytoskeletal reorganization, driving cell migration to injury sites and promoting extracellular matrix formation.

Their mechanisms complement: BPC-157 protects existing tissue and stimulates new vessel formation, while TB-500 mobilizes repair cells and promotes structural regeneration. With hundreds of published studies investigating each peptide individually, researchers increasingly combine them to model multi-phase tissue healing—from acute injury response through complete structural restoration.

**A strategically modified fragment of growth hormone's C-terminus—retaining lipolytic activity while eliminating GH receptor activation and IGF-1 elevation.**

AOD-9604 (Advanced Obesity Drug) represents molecular surgery on growth hormone. Australian researchers at Monash University identified the 176-191 C-terminal region as responsible for GH's lipolytic effects, then added stabilizing modifications to create a fragment that stimulates lipolysis without growth hormone receptor binding. The result: a peptide that mimics GH's fat-mobilizing properties while completely avoiding effects on growth, glucose metabolism, or IGF-1—a clean separation impossible with full-length GH.

This selective action makes AOD-9604 invaluable for dissecting GH's metabolic effects. Researchers can investigate lipolytic signaling mechanisms, study adipocyte beta-oxidation, and explore growth hormone's metabolic functions without the confounding variables of receptor-mediated GH actions.

**SEO Title:** "5-Amino-1MQ 5mg | ≥98% Pure | NNMT Enzyme Inhibitor | PRC Peptides"

**A selective small molecule inhibitor of nicotinamide N-methyltransferase—increasing cellular NAD+ availability through enzymatic blockade of the methylation pathway.**

5-Amino-1-methylquinolinium targets a metabolic bottleneck: nicotinamide N-methyltransferase (NNMT), an enzyme that consumes NAD+ precursors by methylating nicotinamide for excretion. By inhibiting NNMT, 5-Amino-1MQ preserves intracellular nicotinamide, allowing its recycling back to NAD+ through the salvage pathway. This mechanism provides an alternative approach to NAD+ augmentation—rather than supplying more precursor, block the pathway that depletes it.

NNMT overexpression correlates with metabolic dysfunction and adiposity in preclinical models, suggesting this enzyme represents a metabolic control point. Research with 5-Amino-1MQ explores NNMT's role in NAD+ homeostasis, methylation reactions, energy metabolism, and the enzyme's potential as a metabolic regulatory target.

**The essential cofactor for mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation—a quaternary ammonium compound that shuttles long-chain fatty acids across the impermeable inner mitochondrial membrane.**

L-Carnitine (β-hydroxy-γ-trimethylaminobutyric acid) solves a fundamental problem in cellular energetics: long-chain fatty acids cannot cross the inner mitochondrial membrane where beta-oxidation occurs. Carnitine serves as the shuttle—the carnitine palmitoyltransferase (CPT) system conjugates fatty acids to carnitine, transports them across the membrane, then releases them inside the mitochondrial matrix. Without adequate carnitine, long-chain fatty acids cannot be oxidized for energy, regardless of other metabolic factors.

This bottleneck role makes L-carnitine fundamental to metabolic research. Studies of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, investigation of the carnitine shuttle mechanism, research into acyl-carnitine species as metabolic biomarkers, and exploration of carnitine's role in various metabolic states all require this essential cofactor.

### Thioctic Acid (Alpha-Lipoic Acid) (25mg/5ml)
**Antioxidant Cofactor** | **Purity:** ≥98% | **Origin:** Biosynthetic production

**SEO Title:** "Alpha-Lipoic Acid 25mg/5ml | ≥98% Pure | Universal Antioxidant | PRC Peptides"

**The only antioxidant that functions in both aqueous and lipid environments—a dithiol cofactor essential for mitochondrial energy metabolism and capable of regenerating other antioxidants.**

Alpha-lipoic acid (1,2-dithiolane-3-pentanoic acid) occupies a unique position in antioxidant biology: its amphipathic structure allows it to scavenge reactive species in both water-soluble compartments (cytoplasm) and lipid-rich environments (membranes)—a property no other antioxidant possesses. Beyond direct free radical neutralization, lipoic acid serves as an essential cofactor for mitochondrial α-ketoacid dehydrogenase complexes (pyruvate dehydrogenase, α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase), linking its antioxidant function directly to energy metabolism.

The reduced form (dihydrolipoic acid) demonstrates remarkable antioxidant activity, directly scavenging reactive oxygen and nitrogen species while regenerating other antioxidants—reducing oxidized vitamin C, vitamin E, and glutathione back to their active forms. This antioxidant network amplification makes lipoic acid a force multiplier in cellular antioxidant defense.

### Vitamin C (Ascorbic Acid) (10mg/20ml)
**Water-Soluble Antioxidant** | **Purity:** Pharmaceutical grade | **Origin:** Pharmaceutical manufacture

**SEO Title:** "Vitamin C 10mg/20ml | Pharmaceutical Grade | Ascorbic Acid Injectable | PRC Peptides"

**The essential water-soluble antioxidant and enzymatic cofactor—a powerful reducing agent required for collagen synthesis, neurotransmitter production, and immune cell function.**

L-Ascorbic acid (vitamin C) serves multiple critical biochemical roles beyond its well-known antioxidant function. As a cofactor for prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases, ascorbate is absolutely required for collagen triple helix stability—without adequate vitamin C, collagen synthesis fails, manifesting as scurvy. The vitamin also serves as cofactor for dopamine β-hydroxylase (converting dopamine to norepinephrine) and other copper-containing monooxygenases essential for neurotransmitter synthesis.

As an antioxidant, ascorbate directly reduces reactive oxygen species and serves as the first line of defense in aqueous environments. It functions synergistically with vitamin E by reducing tocopheroxyl radicals back to active tocopherol, linking water-soluble and lipid-soluble antioxidant systems. This pharmaceutical-grade injectable preparation enables precise dosing in controlled research applications.

**SEO Title:** "SS-31 (Elamipretide) 10mg | ≥98% Pure | Cardiolipin-Targeting Peptide | PRC Peptides"

**The first peptide to selectively target and protect the inner mitochondrial membrane—an aromatic-cationic tetrapeptide that binds cardiolipin to stabilize cristae structure and reduce ROS production.**

SS-31 (Szeto-Schiller peptide 31, D-Arg-Dmt-Lys-Phe-NH2) represents a breakthrough in mitochondria-targeted therapeutics. This cell-permeable tetrapeptide contains alternating cationic and aromatic residues that enable it to penetrate cells and selectively accumulate at the inner mitochondrial membrane, where it binds with high affinity to cardiolipin—the signature phospholipid of mitochondrial membranes. This cardiolipin interaction stabilizes cristae architecture, the elaborately folded inner membrane structures that house the electron transport chain.

Unlike broad antioxidants, SS-31 concentrates precisely where mitochondrial ROS are generated—at the electron transport chain. By optimizing cristae structure and reducing electron leak, SS-31 decreases reactive oxygen species production at the source while preserving mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP synthesis. This mechanism has made SS-31 invaluable in ischemia-reperfusion research, neurodegenerative disease models, and studies of mitochondrial dysfunction.

## Senolytic & Longevity Research

### FOXO4-DRI (10mg)
**Senolytic Peptide** | **Purity:** ≥98% | **Origin:** Erasmus Medical Center, Netherlands

**SEO Title:** "FOXO4-DRI 10mg | ≥98% Pure | Senolytic Peptide Disruptor | PRC Peptides"

**The first peptide-based senolytic—a D-retro-inverso modified sequence that selectively disrupts the FOXO4-p53 interaction in senescent cells, triggering their apoptotic elimination.**

FOXO4-DRI represents molecular precision in anti-aging research. Senescent cells—aged cells that cease dividing but resist apoptosis—accumulate with age and secrete inflammatory factors (the senescence-associated secretory phenotype, SASP) that damage surrounding tissues. Dutch researchers discovered that in senescent cells, FOXO4 protein binds and sequesters p53, preventing p53-mediated apoptosis. FOXO4-DRI, a peptide mimicking the p53-binding domain of FOXO4, competitively disrupts this interaction—freeing p53 to trigger apoptosis specifically in senescent cells.

The D-retro-inverso modification—constructing the peptide from D-amino acids in reverse sequence—creates a molecule with identical binding surface topology but dramatically enhanced proteolytic stability. This senolytic approach—selectively eliminating senescent cells while sparing healthy ones—represents a targeted strategy for addressing cellular aging.

**Research Applications:** 
Senescent cell biology, FOXO4-p53 interaction studies, senolytic mechanism research, cellular aging models, apoptosis pathway research, SASP modulation, targeted cellular aging interventions

### Epithalon (50mg)
**Telomerase Modulator** | **Purity:** ≥98% | **Origin:** St. Petersburg Institute of Bioregulation and Gerontology, Russia

**SEO Title:** "Epithalon 50mg | ≥98% Pure | Telomerase Activator Peptide | PRC Peptides"

**A synthetic tetrapeptide that mimics the pineal gland's epithalamin—demonstrating telomerase activation and circadian regulation in aging research models.**

Epithalon (Epitalon, Ala-Glu-Asp-Gly) emerged from decades of Russian gerontology research led by Professor Vladimir Khavinson. This tetrapeptide, designed to replicate bioactive sequences from the pineal peptide epithalamin, demonstrates two remarkable properties in experimental models: activation of telomerase (the enzyme that maintains telomere length) and modulation of circadian rhythms through melatonin regulation. These dual mechanisms position Epithalon at the intersection of cellular aging and chronobiology research.

Telomeres—the protective caps on chromosome ends—shorten with each cell division, eventually triggering senescence. Telomerase can extend telomeres, but most somatic cells suppress this enzyme. Epithalon's apparent ability to transiently activate telomerase in adult tissues has driven extensive research into its mechanism and potential for studying telomere biology and cellular aging interventions.

**Research Applications:** 
Telomerase activity research, telomere biology, circadian rhythm regulation, pineal peptide research, cellular aging mechanisms, melatonin regulation studies, longevity pathway research

**Molecular Profile:**
- Formula: C14H22N4O9

**SEO Title:** "PE 22-28 10mg | ≥98% Pure | TREK-1 Channel Modulator | PRC Peptides"

**A synthetic fragment of the sortilin propeptide—a heptapeptide that modulates TREK-1 potassium channels to influence neuroplasticity and neuroprotection.**

PE 22-28 represents targeted neuroplasticity research. This heptapeptide, corresponding to amino acids 22-28 of the propeptide region of sortilin (a protein involved in neurotrophin sorting), was identified through research into spadin—an endogenous peptide with neuroprotective properties. PE 22-28 interacts with TREK-1 (TWIK-related potassium channel), a background potassium channel involved in neuronal excitability, synaptic plasticity, and stress response.

By modulating TREK-1 channel activity, PE 22-28 influences neuronal membrane potential and excitability, with downstream effects on neurotrophic signaling and synaptic remodeling. Research suggests this peptide may enhance neuroplasticity—the brain's capacity to reorganize synaptic connections—making it valuable for studying neuroadaptation, neuroprotection mechanisms, and the role of potassium channels in cognitive function.

**SEO Title:** "PT-141 (Bremelanotide) | ≥98% Pure | MC3R/MC4R Agonist | PRC Peptides"

**A cyclic heptapeptide melanocortin agonist with preferential activity at MC3R and MC4R—a Melanotan II metabolite engineered for selective melanocortin receptor research.**

PT-141 emerged from structure-activity relationship studies of Melanotan II, a synthetic α-MSH analogue. While Melanotan II activates multiple melanocortin receptor subtypes (MC1R through MC5R), its metabolite PT-141 demonstrates preferential activity at MC3R and MC4R with reduced MC1R activation—eliminating much of the pigmentation effect while retaining central melanocortin activity. This selectivity makes PT-141 invaluable for dissecting the distinct roles of melanocortin receptor subtypes.

MC3R and MC4R, expressed primarily in the hypothalamus, regulate energy balance, autonomic function, and motivated behaviors through melanocortin signaling. PT-141 enables researchers to study these central melanocortin pathways without the confounding peripheral effects of broader melanocortin activation, making it the preferred tool for investigating hypothalamic melanocortin biology.

**Research Applications:** 
Melanocortin receptor subtype pharmacology, MC3R/MC4R signaling research, central melanocortin pathway studies, receptor selectivity research, hypothalamic signaling mechanisms, melanocortin system biology

This exquisite molecular specificity makes botulinum toxin invaluable beyond its clinical applications. Researchers studying SNARE protein biology, investigating synaptic vesicle fusion mechanisms, exploring neuromuscular junction physiology, or dissecting the molecular machinery of exocytosis rely on BoNT/A's specific, irreversible SNAP-25 cleavage. The toxin serves as a molecular scalpel that precisely disrupts a single step in neurotransmitter release.

**Research Applications:** 
SNARE protein biology, synaptic vesicle fusion mechanisms, neuromuscular junction research, acetylcholine release studies, exocytosis research, presynaptic signaling, metalloprotease mechanism studies

**Molecular Profile:**
- Molecular Weight: ~150 kDa (holotoxin)

## Tissue Protection & Repair (Advanced)

### ARA-290 (10mg)
**Innate Repair Receptor Agonist** | **Purity:** ≥98% | **Origin:** Derived from erythropoietin research, Netherlands

**SEO Title:** "ARA-290 10mg | ≥98% Pure | Tissue-Protective EPO Derivative | PRC Peptides"

**An 11-amino acid fragment of erythropoietin engineered to selectively activate the innate repair receptor—providing tissue protection and anti-inflammatory signaling without erythropoietic activity.**

ARA-290 represents molecular refinement of erythropoietin's tissue-protective properties. While full-length EPO stimulates red blood cell production through the classical EPO receptor, it also activates a distinct receptor complex called the innate repair receptor (IRR or tissue-protective receptor)—a heteromeric complex that triggers cell protection, reduces inflammation, and promotes tissue repair. ARA-290, an 11-amino acid EPO-derived peptide, selectively activates the IRR without engaging the erythropoietic EPO receptor.

This separation of functions enables clean investigation of EPO's tissue-protective mechanisms without the confounding hematological effects. Research has demonstrated ARA-290's effects in neuropathy models, ischemia-reperfusion injury, and inflammatory conditions—all mediated through IRR signaling pathways distinct from classical EPO effects. The peptide provides a unique tool for studying tissue protection mechanisms and innate repair receptor biology.
