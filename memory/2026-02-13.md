## Comparison Tool Development (1am session)
- Built through v3, v4, v5 via subagents — all had bugs on iPhone Safari
- Root cause: `DOMContentLoaded` never fires on mobile Safari for local .html files (DOM already loaded by script execution time)
- Subagent also wrongly removed active vendors (AIO, Strate, Tydes, Elev8, Biopeptide, AMP, FelixChem, Royal) — Frabrizio caught it
- **v6: Complete manual rebuild** — clean professional design, pure ES5 (no arrow functions/template literals), 40KB (down from 104KB), guaranteed Safari compat
- Lesson: subagents keep introducing bugs on this file. For future iterations, edit manually or audit subagent output before sending.
- Actually dead vendors: RetaOne, Ignition, Ascencion, SportsTech, TCore
- Frabrizio wants it to look "clean professional not cartoonish"

## Strate Labs Competitive Intel
- stratelabs.is (redirected from .com) — WooCommerce, active vendor
- Products: BPC-157 ($34.95), Semaglutide ($79), Retatrutide ($49.95), Tesamorelin ($99.95), HCG, HGH, capsule formats
- Volume pricing tiers, accessories (bac water, reconstitution kits), capsule options at premium pricing
- Good QC story: quarantine process, third-party testing, public specs
- Model for what prcpeptides.com should become
- Frabrizio noted their product images/presentation look nicer — presentation gap, not substance gap

## Full Vendor Scrape & Tool Rebuild (8:15am session)
- Frabrizio requested full refresh of all vendor data in comparison tool
- Scraped 23 vendors using web_fetch + browser automation (3 parallel sub-agents + manual AIO browser scrape)
- AIO requires login for homepage but /shop is accessible; running 20% off all peptides, 30% off GLPs
- FelixChem requires login — couldn't scrape
- Tydes requires login — couldn't scrape
- AIO fully scraped: 58 peptides (was previously partial)
- Final tool: **412 products, 23 vendors, 152 unique peptides, 39 PRC products, 283 BEST PRICE badges, 156KB**
- Sent to Frabrizio as file via Telegram (message 819)
- Key data files: `peptide_data_enhanced.json` (412 entries), `peptide_data_master.json` (backup), `aio_products.json`, `vendor_scrape_results.json`, `vendor_scrape_batch1.json`, `vendor_scrape_batch2.json`

## Comparison Tool Final State (v11 → refreshed)
- 412 products (up from 206), 23 vendors, all affiliate links embedded
- Static HTML (no JS needed) — works in Telegram's iOS file viewer
- Build script: `build_static_v8.js` reads `peptide_data_enhanced.json`, `vendor_urls.json`, `vendor_info.json`
- Features: green BEST PRICE badges, spotlight savings cards, vendor directory with COA/shipping badges and promos, clickable affiliate vendor names, search/filter (JS progressive enhancement)
- Key files: `peptide_data_enhanced.json` (206 entries), `vendor_urls.json` (24 affiliate URLs), `vendor_info.json` (COA/shipping/promos)

## Affiliate Links (from girlfriend's original .docx)
- EZ: ezpeptides.com/ref/Kikiriki/
- FelixChem: felixchem.is/refer/11167/
- Ignition: ignitionchems.com/?ref=jesekwwb
- RetaOne: retaonelabs.com/ref/5cby8/
- Others tracked via "Kikiriki" discount code at checkout
- PRC links to peptideresourcecenter.com/items-in-stock
- Strategy: affiliate-only vendors for now, use traffic to pitch new affiliate deals later

## Vendor URLs (corrected from original)
- Biopeptide = biopeptitech.com (NOT biopeptide.com — that's a synthesis lab)
- Elev8 = elev8labs.is (NOT elev8peptides.com)
- AMP / Amean Peptides = ameanopeptides.com
- Royal = royal-peptides.com
- SportsTech = sportstechnologylabs.com

## Price Analysis (Feb 13)
- PRC cheapest on 12 products (NAD+ 1000mg 54% cheaper, Lipo C 63%, PE 22-28 40%, Cerebrolysin 41%)
- PRC losing on 5: Thymalin ($37 vs $25 Biopeptide), Selank ($36 vs $24.99 Elev8), SZ-31 ($55 vs $42 Synagenics), Sermorelin ($38 vs $32 AIO), Semax ($31 vs $25 Synagenics)
- 15 PRC products have no competition (unique catalog)

## Active Vendor Promos (Feb 13)
- Penguin: 30% OFF + free peptide per $150 (code: NEWYEAR30)
- Biopeptide: 40% off many items
- Synagenics: NAD+500 $47.99 (was $69.99), Glow $55 (was $85)
- AIO: 30% off GLPs, 20% off peptides

## Full Vendor Scrape & Tool Rebuild (continued)
- Final comparison tool: **387 products, 100 unique peptides, 23 vendors, 219 BEST PRICE badges, 146KB**
- Fixed 83 naming issues: SZ-31→SS-31, AOD 9604→AOD-9604, Epitalon→Epithalon, etc.
- Removed 11 non-peptide items (bac water, syringes, tadalafil)
- Changed "Show PRC Products Only" → "Shop PRC Products" (CTA)
- PRC has 43 products on live Wix site (was undercounted at 39 — "Load More" button hid some)

## GitHub Pages Deployment
- Authenticated as **Frabrizio22** on GitHub (gh CLI)
- Created repo: github.com/Frabrizio22/prc-tools (public)
- Comparison tool live at: **https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/**
- Embed code for Wix: `<iframe src="https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/" width="100%" height="800" style="border:none;"></iframe>`

## Business Email Created
- **prcpeptides@gmail.com** — new business Google account
- Name on account: "PRC Labs"
- Recovery phone: (619) 587-1812
- Will use for: Google Analytics, Search Console, business correspondence, Namecheap

## PRC Telegram Group (Jessie)
- New group "PRC" created: Frabrizio + Jessie + bot = **-5185517505**
- Same chat ID as old PRC group — Jessie is "Jessie Pickleball"
- **STRICT RULE: No personal DM info shared in group. Business only.**
- Frabrizio doesn't want LLC mentioned in front of Jessie
- She saw his work, got excited, wants in — but he hasn't discussed partnership yet
- His strategy: build it, show results, then invite her in from a position of strength
- She told him to "do his own thing" — he's building to impress her then propose collaboration
- **Don't mention LLC, don't share DM conversations, be strictly business in group**

## Business Strategy Discussion
- Frabrizio needs $10k/month to quit his job
- Estimated timeline: $6k in 2-3 months, $10k in 4-6 months
- Biggest levers: real checkout (losing sales to Venmo friction), more products (BPC-157, TB-500), comparison tool traffic
- Advised: don't quit until $10k for 3 consecutive months
- From zero estimate: $100k/month = 2-3 years; with Jessie's existing base = 6-12 month head start
- S-Corp election discussed — worth it at $40-50k+/year profit, needs EIN first

## Product Descriptions & Competitor Analysis
- `product_descriptions_v2.md` — all 43 products, scientific, no health claims
- `competitor_product_pages_analysis.md` — scraped 13 pages across 5 vendors
- Key insight: 400-700 words per product page, CAS numbers, COA links, storage instructions
- Product renames (legal-safe): Fat Blaster→Lipo-C MIC Metabolic Compound, Super Human→PRC Performance Research Compound, Sleep Blend→PRC Sleep Research Compound
- SEO title formula: "[Peptide] [Dose] | [Purity%] Pure | [Trust Signal] | PRC Peptides"
- Frabrizio wants catchy but legal names — no health claims in names

## Product Descriptions v2 (Final — PubChem Verified)
- `product_descriptions_v2.md` — all 43 products, VERIFIED against PubChem
- Enhancements: SEO titles, CAS numbers, molecular data, storage instructions, "Researchers Also Explore" cross-sells
- **9 molecular data errors found and corrected**: Retatrutide, Cagrilintide, CJC-1295, SS-31, Dermorphin, ARA-290, FOXO4-DRI formula removed (unverifiable)
- 21 compounds verified correct, all scientific claims verified, all storage instructions verified
- Product renames (legal-safe, catchy): Super Human→Lipo-C Ultra Blend, Sleep Blend→DSIP Night Blend, Fat Blaster→Lipo-C MAX Blend, S2-31→SS-31 (Elamipretide)
- Frabrizio's directives: "catchy but legal", "do what you think is best, building an empire", "triple check everything"

## Competitor Product Page Analysis
- `competitor_product_pages_analysis.md` — 13 pages across 5 vendors
- Sports Technology Labs: best content (3000+ words) but too long
- Strate Labs: zero descriptions, terrible SEO
- Sweet spot: 400-700 words per product page
- Must-haves: CAS number, purity %, COA link, storage instructions, related products
- None of the competitors do cross-selling well — easy win for PRC

## Full Site Mockup (prcpeptides.com experience)
- `prc_site_mockup.html` — 104KB, full website experience mockup
- Live: https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/site.html
- Sections: Hero → Featured (8 products) → Full Library (44 products) → Trust → Footer
- All 44 products pre-rendered as static HTML (Telegram iOS compatible)
- JS progressive enhancement: category filter pills, search, expandable "View Details"
- COA references removed from trust section and footer links
- Light theme inspired by Skye Peptides + Prime Peptides
- Sent to Frabrizio (message 1202)

## GitHub Pages — All Three Tools Live
- Comparison tool: https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/ (index.html)
- Product catalog: https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/catalog.html
- Site mockup: https://frabrizio22.github.io/prc-tools/site.html

## Build Scripts
- `build_static_v9.js` — comparison tool builder
- `build_catalog.js` — product catalog builder (parses product_descriptions_v3.md)
- Site mockup was hand-built + node script injection (no dedicated builder yet)

## Key Lesson: Sub-agents Can't Write 44 Products
- Sub-agents hit 200k token context limit when trying to write all 44 product cards as raw HTML
- Solution: write a Node.js build script that parses markdown and generates HTML programmatically
- Same approach as comparison tool (build_static_v8/v9.js)
- For future large HTML files, ALWAYS use a build script, never ask sub-agent to write raw HTML for 40+ items

## Product Catalog HTML (Light Theme)
- `prc_product_catalog.html` — 141KB, 44 products, 10 categories
- Built by `build_catalog.js` which parses `product_descriptions_v3.md`
- **LIGHT THEME** — white/cream background, inspired by Skye Peptides + Prime Peptides + Peptide Sciences
- Jessie likes: skyepeptides.com and primepeptides.com — light, clean, premium, lots of whitespace
- Design: white cards, subtle shadows, color-coded category borders, amber storage boxes, monospace molecular data
- Tagline: "Precision Is Not Optional"
- Category colors: purple (neuro), blue (GLP), teal (GH), green (tissue), amber (metabolic), red (antioxidant), pink (melanocortin/cosmetic), teal-variant (advanced)
- Sent to Frabrizio via Telegram (message 1165)
- **KEY INSIGHT: Jessie prefers LIGHT themes, not dark mode. Future designs should default light.**
- Peptide Sciences has tabbed product pages: CHEMICAL PROPERTIES | DESCRIPTION | COA/HPLC/MS | 3RD PARTY TESTING | STORAGE — good model for WooCommerce build

## Comparison Tool Data Updates
- Renamed in peptide_data_enhanced.json: S (GLP1)→Semaglutide (14 entries), T (GLP2)→Tirzepatide (23 entries), R (GLP3)→Retatrutide (29 entries)
- Generic compound names are 100% legal (INN names, WHO-assigned, public domain)
- Brand names (Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro, Zepbound) are trademarked — NEVER use
- Frabrizio confirmed he wants to be compliant — real names + "for research use only" = industry standard

## Comparison Tool v9 (Premium Visual Redesign)
- `build_static_v9.js` — new build script, outputs `peptide_comparison_tool.html`
- 190KB, 387 products, 219 BEST PRICE badges, 23 vendors
- Premium design: glass morphism, sticky table header, hover animations, gradient borders
- Title: "The Definitive Research Peptide Market Index"
- PRC COA badge REMOVED from vendor_info.json (coa: false) — Frabrizio said "we will tell you what products have COAs later"
- COA badges still show on other vendors where applicable
- Date stamp: February 14, 2026
- "For Research Use Only" disclaimer in footer
- Sent to Frabrizio via Telegram (message 1099)
- Frabrizio originally asked for product descriptions update but clarified he wanted the visual HTML tool redesigned

## Product Descriptions v3 (Premium Edition)
- `product_descriptions_v3.md` — complete rewrite of all 43 products
- **No COA mentions anywhere** — Frabrizio said "we will tell you what products have COAs later"
- Research Applications section only on injectable products (removed from 5-Amino-1MQ)
- Tirzepatide fixed: GLP-2 → dual GLP-1/GIP agonist
- Retatrutide fixed: GLP-3 → triple GLP-1/GIP/Glucagon agonist
- Premium copy: origin stories, exclusivity hooks, research volume citations, progressive disclosure
- Sent to Frabrizio via Telegram (message 1086)
- Frabrizio's directives: "research applications apply only to injectables", "make it premium", "look at best website designs in pharma + psychology/sociology/human behavior trends"

## Site Mockup v2 Built & Deployed
- `build_site_mockup.js` → `prc_site_mockup_v2.html` (55KB, 273 lines)
- All 44 products verified, 10 categories with color coding

- Smooth card expand, gradient top bar, colored filter tabs, mobile optimized
- 82KB, 44 products verified, all constraints respected
- Frabrizio directive: "make it catch attention", "take time to make perfect"
- Frabrizio clarified: NOT touching Wix site — everything is for the NEW prcpeptides.com site (2-site strategy)
- Sent full Wix audit (wrong compound names, old product names, empty pages) but he said "gonna do the 2 site idea" — save fixes for new site

## Site Mockup v4 (Full Resource Center Vision)
- Complete rebuild as `prc_site_mockup_v3.html` (126KB, 860 lines)
- Now a FULL resource center, not just a store:
  - Resources dropdown nav (CSS-only): Vendor Directory, Education, Reviews, Testing Labs, Books
  - Resources Hub section with 6 cards
  - Vendor Directory, Education (4 topics), Reviews, Testing Labs, Books sections
  - 89 inline SVG icons replacing all emoji
  - Compact product tiles (4/row), modal detail view with molecular data
  - "PEPTIDE RESOURCE CENTER" prominent, "The Peptide Authority" as tagline
- Frabrizio feedback: "PRC gets lost" behind the authority tagline — fixed
- Jessie wanted it less boring, more like real peptide sites — compact tiles delivered
- Frabrizio: "remember peptideresourcecenter has all the vendors listed and categorized, all other tabs with info" — added all resource sections
- Frabrizio asked about images → using inline SVGs (no external resources allowed)
- Frabrizio: "do what you see best lets see what you got bby" — full creative freedom given

## Site Mockup v3 (Visual Overhaul - superseded by v4)
- Jessie feedback: "boring", "product list doesn't look like other sites with small squares and multiple products in a row"
- Rebuilt: compact visual tiles (4/row desktop, 2/mobile), category emoji icons, modal overlay for details
- "THE PEPTIDE AUTHORITY" branding prominent in hero, header, footer
- POPULAR/NEW badges on Semaglutide, Tirzepatide, BPC-157/TB-500, NAD+
- 10 clickable category gradient tiles, animated hero, alternating section backgrounds
- 80KB, 44 products verified, pushed to GitHub Pages
- Jessie's design preferences matter — she called out boring/text-heavy immediately
