            <h2>The Laboratory Supply Problem</h2>
            <p>Research-grade peptide procurement suffers from a systemic failure: predatory markups in the reagent supply chain. Independent researchers—the majority of peptide users—face 300-400% margins imposed by distributors who add zero value beyond logistics.</p>
            <p>PRC Labs LLC exists to eliminate the middleman tax. We function as a high-efficiency procurement partner, sourcing ≥98% purity synthesized compounds directly from GMP-compliant manufacturers and passing institutional-grade pricing to independent research entities.</p>

        <div class="about-section">
            <h2>Quality Verification Protocol</h2>
            <p>Every compound undergoes independent third-party verification via High-Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Mass Spectrometry. We maintain certificates of analysis (COAs) documenting batch purity, molecular weight confirmation, and peptide sequence integrity.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Minimum ≥98% purity specification on all lyophilized peptides</li>
                <li>Dual-method verification (HPLC + Mass Spec)</li>
                <li>Batch-specific COAs available upon request</li>
                <li>Complimentary laboratory reagent preparation kit with analytical-grade diluents</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Each order includes a complimentary laboratory reagent preparation kit containing pharmaceutical-grade bacteriostatic water and standard analytical preparation tools for immediate experimental use.</p>

            <h2>Independent Research Viability</h2>
            <p>We support longitudinal study feasibility by removing cost barriers. Our transparent pricing model—including direct competitor comparison tools—reflects a commitment to honest market positioning rather than margin optimization.</p>
            <p>No clinical claims. No lifestyle marketing. No influencer campaigns. We provide molecular compounds with documented purity specifications for researchers conducting in vitro assays and receptor affinity studies.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p>Our "for research purposes only" designation is not legal cover—it reflects our operational mandate. We exist exclusively to serve qualified researchers conducting legitimate laboratory work.</p>
