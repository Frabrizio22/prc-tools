## Reddit Setup
- Frabrizio created Reddit account: **PeptideResearchGuy** (prcpeptides@gmail.com)
- Joined: r/peptides, r/Peptidesource, r/NootropicsHelp, r/PeptideScholars, r/PeptideStacks
- Skipped: r/SafePeptides (vendor shill sub), r/peptidess (knockoff), r/Nootropics2 (tiny)
- r/SARMs main sub appears banned/quarantined — couldn't find it
- **r/peptides has BANNED all source discussion** (pinned mod post by Majalisk). No vendor mentions allowed. Focus on knowledge/credibility only.
- r/Peptidesource (63K) is where sourcing talk happens — most important sub for PRC
- Day 1: upvote + lurk only. No commenting for 2 days. Comments ready for day 3+.
- Upvote strategy: posts about reconstitution, dosing, storage, BPC-157, semaglutide, tirzepatide, NAD+, purity testing, COAs. Don't upvote everything randomly.
- Found interesting post in r/peptidess — vendor talking about payment processor nightmares (relatable)

## Product Pages v3
- Rebuilt all 44 product pages via build script
- Template: /workspace/product_page_template.html
