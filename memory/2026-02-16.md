# 2026-02-16 — Shop & Checkout Build Day

## Checkout System Built & Deployed
- Full custom checkout on GitHub Pages: checkout.html + order-confirmed.html
- 4-step flow: Cart → Info → Shipping → Payment → Confirmation
- Payments: Crypto (auto via Cloudflare Worker → Coinbase Commerce), Zelle 5% off (619-587-1812)
- CashApp REMOVED — Frabrizio banned personally, will retry under LLC
- Shipping: $9.99 standard, $19.99 expedited, free over $150
- Order numbers: PRC-XXXXX format
- Email notification via mailto: to support@prcpeptides.com

## Cloudflare Worker Deployed
- Worker: prc-checkout.prcpeptides.workers.dev
- Auto-creates Coinbase Commerce charges for crypto payments
- Account: prcpeptides@gmail.com
- API token in .env (CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN)

## Checkout QA
- Round 1 COMPLETE: 🔒 Secure badge, "SAVE 5%" copy, promo code in Order Summary, Place Order disabled until payment selected, disclaimers added
- Round 2 IN PROGRESS: Reviewing JS logic from offset ~1150. Known issue: `cashapp` still referenced in discount logic — needs cleanup

## Shop Improvements
- Add to Cart system with cart drawer, qty controls, toast notifications (commit 61ad399)
- SVG info icons on product cards (commit de17e65)
- COA "Request COA" mailto links in modals (commit 001f510)
- About page rewritten: "Built by Researchers, for Researchers" (commit e257c9b)
- Storage info in modals (conditional by product type)
- Reverted QA clutter (fa1b2d2), applied gold standard fixes (dbf8721)
- Bestsellers reordered: Semaglutide → Tirzepatide 30mg → Retatrutide 20mg → BPC/TB → NAD+ → Sermorelin (3d30f7f)

## Competitor Checkout Audit
- Core Peptides: ACH via Plaid, Zelle 5% off, CashApp 5% off, debit-only via idem
- Biotech: Authorize.Net, ACH e-check, CashApp
- Limitless: Shopify but invoice-only off-platform
- Universal rule: "Don't mention peptides" in payment notes
- Nobody uses Stripe/PayPal/Square

## Zelle Setup
- Phone: (619) 587-1812
- Shows Frabrizio's name for now; will show business name after LLC bank (Mercury)

## Email Forwarding Confirmed Working
- support@prcpeptides.com → prcpeptides@gmail.com (Namecheap redirect)

## Coinbase Commerce Setup
- API key: eebc936a-18a8-4286-aa5d-dca4ba6a9464 (in .env)
- Settlement: USDC
- Display name: PRC Peptides
- Frabrizio changed Coinbase email to support@prcpeptides.com

## prcpeptides.com LIVE
- DNS was already pointed (we did it earlier, forgot). Added CNAME file to repo + configured GitHub Pages custom domain.
- SSL cert was provisioning — HTTPS may be live now. Check with `curl -sI https://prcpeptides.com`
- Created index.html (copy of shop.html) so root loads directly without redirect
- **Must keep index.html in sync with shop.html** after any shop edits

## Hero Changes
- Removed logo from hero (cleaner without it)
- Changed "Research-Grade Peptides" → "≥98% Purity Peptides" (Frabrizio confirmed >98% purity)
- Removed subtitle entirely (was redundant with trust bar)
- Hero is now: "≥98% Purity Peptides" + "No hype. Just peptides." — clean, no subtitle

## Sourcing Clarification
- Frabrizio buys from contact on Alibaba — NOT direct from manufacturer
- Don't claim "direct from manufacturer" anywhere

## Telegram Order Notifications
- Cloudflare Worker updated with `/order` endpoint
- Worker sends Telegram notification to Frabrizio (chat 513307658) for ALL orders
- Bot token and chat ID stored as Cloudflare Worker secrets (TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN, TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID)
- Tested and working

## Google Apps Script — Order Tracker
- Deployed at: https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbzw7r3qHQR3rPiYlCEWl-eFmzlIUKdYLNOPzbKM--pD6k6WZNVAEct95d8ks2NyXZLp_g/exec
- Creates "PRC Orders" spreadsheet in Google Drive (prcpeptides@gmail.com)
- 3 tabs: Dashboard (auto-calculated metrics), Orders (with status dropdown), Products (line items)
- Status dropdown: New → Paid → Shipped → Delivered → Cancelled
- Auto-sends branded HTML confirmation email to customer with payment instructions
- Emails send FROM prcpeptides@gmail.com as "PRC Peptides", reply-to support@prcpeptides.com
- Cloudflare Worker calls Google Apps Script for every order
- Dashboard has #VALUE! errors from header row — will fix itself with real orders or formula fix needed
- **Frabrizio deployed v1 but did NOT redeploy with polished email design** — still has original email template. Updated gas.js is on GitHub but not deployed to Apps Script yet.

## 44 Product Pages Built
- Sub-agent built all 44 at /prc-tools/products/*.html
- Each page: header, breadcrumb, category, title, price, COA badge, full description, research applications (injectable only), storage info, Add to Cart, Request COA, related products, disclaimer, footer
- Pushed to GitHub Pages — e.g. prcpeptides.com/products/semaglutide.html
- **Shop.html NOT yet updated to link to product pages** — still uses modals. Need to wire up links.
- **index.html NOT updated with latest shop.html changes** — needs sync

## Rob's Feedback
- Wants individual product pages (done), product bottle graphics (need photos), full info on each page
- Said modal popup wasn't working well for him — couldn't get info or buy button
- Rob is right — product pages solve all his concerns

## Jessie Content Boundaries
- Frabrizio explicitly said comparison tool, vendor directory, and calculators are Jessie's content/ideas
- DO NOT use these tools in resource center without her involvement
- Resource center strategy: either original blog content only, or work WITH Jessie
- Frabrizio chose to focus on shop + Reddit for now, skip resource center

## Strategy Decisions
- Reddit works without resource center — start posting, link comparison tool for credibility
- No WooCommerce needed yet — custom build works until merchant account
- Product pages become important when Google indexes prcpeptides.com
- Focus: shop + Reddit + orders flowing

## Next Up
- Wire product page links into shop.html (product cards → individual pages)
- Sync index.html with shop.html
- Check SSL cert status
- Gmail filter for support@prcpeptides.com
- Fix Google Sheet dashboard #VALUE! formulas
- Frabrizio needs to redeploy Apps Script with polished email (gas.js on GitHub)
