- Usually available with high-risk account

## 🎓 FINAL WISDOM

The peptide payment processing space is **extremely volatile**. Plan for your processor to drop you eventually - it's not if, but when.

**Sustainable Strategy:**
1. Start with best available processor
2. Build crypto option immediately
3. Always be applying to backup options
4. Save reserves for processor transitions
5. Keep chargeback rate under 1% obsessively
6. Maintain very clear "research only" positioning

**Reality Check:**
At $3k/month, you'll pay ~$200-350/month in processing fees (6-7% + monthly). This is just cost of business in this space. Budget for it.

Consider if the hassle is worth it, or if crypto-only might actually be simpler long-term for this industry.
