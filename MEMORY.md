## 2026-02-12 — Day One
- First session. Frabrizio wants a peptide business focused co-pilot.
- Target: $100k/month revenue.
- My role: strategic operator, not cheerleader. Push for execution.
- **Rob Sandie** is Frabrizio's trusted business advisor. In Telegram groups with us.

## Business: Peptide Resource Center
- URL: peptideresourcecenter.com (Wix), planning prcpeptides.com (WooCommerce)
- Entity: Kikiriki Beauty & Wellness → filing as **PRC Labs LLC** (CA)
- Revenue: ~$3k/month, 20+ products, avg price ~$40
- Payment: manual Venmo/PayPal (no integrated checkout yet)
- Sourcing: China
- No LLC, no business bank account yet — both in progress

## Two-Site Strategy
- Site 1 (Wix): brand hub, education, SEO content
- Site 2 (WooCommerce): direct store with real checkout
- I'm building both improvements and the new site

## Key Decisions
- LLC name: PRC Labs LLC (neutral, won't flag banks) — **FILED ✅** via Tailor Brands
- Domain: prcpeptides.com on Namecheap ($6.79/yr with NEWCOM679) — available, not yet purchased
- Email: support@prcpeptides.com
- Payment processors: Durango, PaymentCloud, eMerchantBroker + Coinbase Commerce
- Don't migrate Wix yet — fix it in place, build new store separately
- Frabrizio doesn't want Fiverr — I'm doing the work
- **Frabrizio does NOT want to do social media** — prefers SEO + email + referral strategy; I write all content
- Canva (free) for visual content — full brand guide created

## Competitive Intelligence
- Price comparison tool: 81 products, 26 vendors — massive SEO asset
- Almost all vendor discount codes are "Kikiriki" (girlfriend's affiliate deals)
- PRC price wins: NAD+ 1000mg (70% cheaper), Cerebrolysin (41%), PE 22-28 (40%)
- PRC overpriced: Selank, Thymalin, Sermorelin vs competitors
- High-demand gaps to fill: BPC-157, TB-500, Tesamorelin, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin

## Business Email
- **prcpeptides@gmail.com** — main business Google account (created Feb 13)

## GitHub
