- Telegram connected (bot token configured, user ID 513307658)
- Rob is mentioned in group context (Frabrizination) — trusted business advisor

## Business: Peptide Resource Center
- **URL:** peptideresourcecenter.com (Wix site)

- **Email:** KIKIRIKI4WELLNESS@GMAIL.COM
- **Revenue:** ~$3k/month
- **Goal:** $100k/month
- **Stage:** Active sales, 20+ products in store
- **Payment:** Venmo & PayPal (wants Zelle too) — HIGH RISK of account freeze
- **Sourcing:** China-sourced peptides
- **Social:** Facebook, Instagram, Skool community
- **Wholesale:** Has a wholesale PDF available

## Late Night Session (7pm-midnight PST)

### COA Discussion
- Frabrizio asked how to verify China supplier COAs
- Current site has COAs in product image galleries (pop up when viewing product)
- I couldn't render them (browser not connected) — asked Frabrizio to screenshot one, still pending
- Gave him red flag checklist and recommended third-party testing via Janoshik

### LLC Filed ✅
- PRC Labs LLC filed through Tailor Brands — dashboard confirmed active
- Warned him to ignore Tailor Brands upsells ("8 mandatory licenses", registered agent, domain)
- Tailor Brands falsely showed prcpeptides.com as unavailable

### Domain
- prcpeptides.com IS available on Namecheap — $6.79/yr with code NEWCOM679
- Told him to grab it directly on Namecheap, not through Tailor Brands
- Corrected myself: no confirmed promo codes exist from Tailor Brands bundle (I speculated earlier, was wrong)

### Facebook Giveaway — 100 Members
- Hydrogen-Rich Water Bottle giveaway (Amazon: https://amzn.to/4abOtXu)
- Skool community join required: https://www.skool.com/peptide-resource-center-3431/about
- Winner announced March 1st
- Cron reminder set: job ID 02c4db2a-9083-4fa2-9f8f-d0fb3a95362c (March 1, 10am PST)

### Two-Site Strategy Update
- Frabrizio concerned about redirect looking bad between sites
- Recommended Option 2: matching branding, separate domains, "Shop Now" button linking
- He confirmed prcpeptides.com can stand alone without resource center
- **Key insight: Frabrizio worried his girlfriend might not link to his store from her site**
- He wants independence — a standalone business that works without her cooperation

### Marketing Preferences
- **Frabrizio does NOT want to do social media, Skool, Facebook, etc.**
- Recommended alternative path: SEO + email marketing + referral program
- He was open to this if I create all the content
- Created full content sample pack → saved to content_samples.md
  - 3 SEO blog posts, 10 social posts, 3-email sequence, 2 Reddit-style answers
- He liked it and asked for more

### Canva / Visual Content
- He asked about images — I can't generate them
- Recommended Canva (free) as easiest option
- He asked for full Canva brand guide with exact specs
- Created canva_brand_guide.md ✅ — complete with color palette, fonts, template specs for all platforms, design rules, step-by-step Canva instructions, and website review
- Brand colors: Deep Navy #0A1628, Science Blue #2B7DE9, Teal #06B6D4, White, Steel Gray #8E99A4, Slate #1E293B
- Fonts: Inter (headings/body), Space Grotesk (accent), JetBrains Mono (data)
- Instagram handle: @peptideresourcecenter (couldn't scrape due to login wall)

### Price Comparison Tool
- Frabrizio sent a .docx with massive price comparison data — 80+ peptides across dozens of vendors
- Converted to CSV: price_comparison.csv (149 rows, 76 peptides)
- Raw text also saved: price_comparison_raw.txt (992 lines)
- **KEY INSIGHT: Almost every discount code is "Kikiriki"** — girlfriend has affiliate deals with nearly every vendor. This is a revenue stream.
- PRC only sells 4 products directly: Dermorphin ($22), Lemon/Pine Bottle ($65/$49.50), Sleep Blend ($42), Super Human Blend ($42)
- Huge opportunity: expand direct catalog instead of sending traffic to competitors
- Recommended 3-phase approach:
  1. Clean data → Google Sheet → embed on Wix now
  2. Interactive comparison tool on WooCommerce site with filters + "Buy from PRC" buttons
  3. Expand own catalog to capture more direct sales
- Data issues found: vendor URLs instead of names, "Kikirkiki" typo, missing prices on some entries, product names still need renaming
- Frabrizio asked if this was best approach, I confirmed YES — positions as authority, drives SEO, earns affiliate commissions even on competitor sales
- Completed final CSV: price_comparison_final.csv (172 rows, 81 products, 26 vendors)
- Competitive analysis: price_comparison_analysis.md
- **PRC price wins:** NAD+ 1000mg 70% cheaper, Cerebrolysin 41% cheaper, PE 22-28 40% cheaper
- **PRC overpriced:** Selank 5mg ($36 vs $24.99), Thymalin ($37 vs $25), Sermorelin ($38 vs $32)
- **High-demand gaps (no PRC offering):** BPC-157, TB-500, Tesamorelin, CJC-1295, Ipamorelin
- Sent both CSV files to Frabrizio via Telegram for iPhone/Google Sheets
- No email set up yet (gog CLI has no auth tokens) — need to configure Google account for email access

### Interactive Price Comparison Tool ✅
- Built full standalone HTML tool: peptide_comparison_tool.html (62KB)
- Single file, vanilla JS, works on iPhone Safari
- Features: search, filter by vendor/strength, sortable columns, PRC products highlighted in teal, "BEST PRICE" badges, click-to-copy discount codes, PRC spotlight cards, CSV export, mobile responsive
- Brand colors applied, Inter font, premium look
- Can be embedded in Wix via iframe or on WooCommerce site
- Sent to Frabrizio via Telegram — he opened it, it worked!
- Frabrizio's philosophy: "no gatekeeping" — show all vendors, let researchers decide. Keep comparison transparent.
- Recommended adding: COA Available, PRC Verified, Ships From, Payment Methods columns in future
- V1 bug: BEST PRICE showed on all PRC products when PRC-only filter was on (calculated from filtered data, not full data)
- V2 rebuilt with: bug fix, PRC spotlight hero cards, animated counters, category filter tabs (GLP/Nootropics/Growth/Anti-Inflammatory/Blends/Other), side-by-side comparison mode, smart search with suggestions, particle background, micro-animations, savings % tags on PRC rows
- Hosting: python3 http.server + cloudflared tunnel for live preview on iPhone
- Tunnel URL: stickers-budgets-joel-charter.trycloudflare.com (temporary, dies when Mac sleeps)
- Frabrizio loved the concept, wants "the best tool on the market" — gave full green light to go all out
- Cloudflared installed via brew for future tunnel needs

### Vendor Research ✅
- Checked all 24 existing vendors: 11 active, 13 dead/inactive (54% attrition!)
- Dead vendors removed: AIO, AMP, Biopeptide, RetaOne, Strate, Felix Chem, Royal, Ignition, Ascencion, SportsTech, TCore, Tydes, Elev8 (South Africa)
- Active vendors kept: Synagenics, EZ Peptides, TruLab, Penguin, Authentic Aminos, Biolongevity Labs, Instant, Orbitrex, BC9, EQNO, Amean Peptides
- New vendors to add: Limitless Life Nootropics, Core Peptides, SwissChems, Nootropic Source, Peptide Sciences, Paradigm Peptides
- Blocked by Cloudflare (couldn't scrape): Peptide Sciences, Paradigm Peptides, PureRawz
- Full research saved: vendor_research.md
- V3 building with cleaned data, new vendors, vendor directory section, updated spotlight cards with competitor names
- Key market insight: high vendor turnover — need monthly price verification

### Files Created This Session
- content_samples.md — blog posts, social posts, emails, Reddit answers
- canva_brand_guide.md — brand colors, fonts, template specs, Canva instructions, site review
- price_comparison.csv — first pass CSV (149 rows)

### Traveling to Paris
- Flight imminent (~hours away as of early session)
- Suggested he talk to girlfriend about business structure on the plane

## Product Catalog (from store page)
Categories: Anti-Inflammatory, Growth Hormones, Vitamins, Nootropics
Products include: Selank (5mg/$36, 10mg/$36), Botulinum Toxin 200u/$170, T(GLP2) 20mg/$44 & 30mg/$46, Laennec Ampules/$425, NAD 500mg/$30 & 1000mg/$30, Cerebrolysin 60mg/$23, Vitamin C 10mg/$75, Thymalin 10mg/$37, Thioctic Acid/$75, Super Human Blend/$42, S2-31 10mg/$55, Sleep Blend/$42, Sermorelin 5mg/$38, Semax 5mg/$31, S(GLP1)/$30, R(GLP3) 20mg/$55, PT-141/$36, PE 22-28 10mg/$30, MOTS-C 10mg/$28, LL-37 5mg/$29, Lipo C "Fat Blaster"/$42
Average price ~$40. Need ~2,500 orders/mo for $100k target.

## Issues Identified
1. **Payment processing** — Venmo/PayPal will freeze peptide sales accounts. Need high-risk merchant processor ASAP.
2. **"We source from China!!!"** — needs professional reframing
3. **Product names** like "Super Human Blend" and "Fat Blaster" imply human use — compliance risk
4. **Generic product images** — same vial photo for most items
5. **No product descriptions** — just names and prices
6. **No COAs visible** on product pages
7. **No email capture** for retention marketing

## Priorities Given to Frabrizio
1. Fix compliance copy (China messaging, product names)
2. Payment processing — apply to high-risk processors
3. Product page enrichment (descriptions, COAs, images)
4. SEO and email capture

## Answers Received
- **Checkout flow:** Orders come to email, Frabrizio manually collects payment via Venmo/PayPal. No integrated checkout.
- **COAs:** Yes, on the site ✅
- **State:** California ($70 filing + $800/yr franchise tax for LLC)
- **No LLC, no business bank account** — blockers for payment processing
- **Refund policy:** Yes ✅

## Payment Processor Research (completed)
- Top picks: Durango Merchant Services (5-8%), PaymentCloud (4.5-7%), eMerchantBroker (5-9%)
- Coinbase Commerce as immediate backup (1% fees, no approval needed)
- Frame as "research nutraceuticals" / "amino acid research compounds"
- Avoid: Stripe, Square, PayPal, Authorize.Net
- Full research in peptide_payment_processors_research.md

## Site Issues
- Wix mobile layout broken: crammed nav, huge whitespace, products not loading
- Desktop: generic images, no descriptions, "China!!!" copy, human-use product names
- Frabrizio wants better look/function especially mobile
- Options: fix in Wix mobile editor or Fiverr freelancer ($50-100)

## Priority Action Plan
1. File CA LLC → bizfileonline.sos.ca.gov ($70)
2. Get EIN on irs.gov (free, instant)
3. Open business bank account
4. Set up Coinbase Commerce (today, no LLC needed)
5. Apply to high-risk processors
6. Fix site copy and mobile layout

## Two-Site Strategy (decided)
- **Site 1:** peptideresourcecenter.com stays on Wix — brand hub, education, vendor directory, SEO content
- **Site 2:** prcpeptides.com — new WooCommerce store, real checkout, being built by me
- Domain: prcpeptides.com being purchased on Namecheap
- Hosting: Namecheap shared hosting (free year 1 via business starter kit bundle)
- LLC name decided: **PRC Labs LLC** (neutral name to avoid flagging banks/processors)
- Frabrizio needs $70 for CA LLC filing — waiting on funds

## Work In Progress
- Competitor analysis (sub-agent running)
- Product descriptions (sub-agent having issues saving files — may need to write manually)
- WooCommerce site plan (sub-agent running)
- Product rename suggestions: "Super Human Blend" → "PRC Performance Compound Blend", "Sleep Blend" → "PRC Neuropeptide Blend", "Fat Blaster" → "PRC Lipotropic Compound"

## Decisions Made
- Namecheap > GoDaddy for domain
- WordPress + WooCommerce for site 2 (not Shopify — they ban peptides)
- Email: support@prcpeptides.com as primary
- Don't migrate Wix to WP yet — too many changes at once
- Frabrizio building site himself (with my help), not hiring Fiverr
- PRC brand stays — no rebrand

## LLC Filing (in progress via Tailor Brands / Namecheap bundle)
- Name: **PRC Labs LLC** (California)
- Filing through Tailor Brands via Namecheap business starter kit
- Selected: standard processing (14 days), no operating agreement from them (I'll write one), no compliance service (I'll remind)
- Industry listed: E-commerce
- Single-member LLC — Frabrizio only
- **Reminder set** for Feb 2027: Statement of Information filing ($20)
- $800 franchise tax due ~3-4 months after filing

## Girlfriend / Business Partner Situation
- Girlfriend built the original business (peptideresourcecenter.com)
- She does $3k/month via manual Venmo/PayPal (friends & family — unreported income, tax risk)
- She doesn't want LLC or payment processing due to fear of taxes and risk
- She encouraged Frabrizio to start his own business
- Frabrizio filing LLC solo in his name
- Revenue split discussion (not finalized):
  - Option discussed: $4k/month guarantee to her + 50/50 net profit above that
  - Or: straight 50/50 net profit split
  - Need written agreement — I'll draft operating agreement later
- Her site keeps affiliate income from other brands
- His site (prcpeptides.com) handles actual checkout with real payment processing
- Her "Buy Our Brand" → redirects to his checkout → he pays her share

## Personal
- Frabrizio leaving for Paris in ~12 hours (as of 4pm PST Feb 12)
- All remaining setup (EIN, bank account, Coinbase Commerce, processor apps) can be done virtually from Paris
- Bank recommendation: Mercury (100% online)

## Sub-agent Work Completed
- ✅ Competitor analysis saved to competitor_analysis.md
- ✅ WooCommerce site plan saved to woocommerce_site_plan.md
- ❌ Product descriptions — sub-agents failed to save file 3 times. Need to write manually.

## Cron Jobs Set
